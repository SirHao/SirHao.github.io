                <hr>
                <p>
                  As humans, things, software and AI continue to become the entangled fabric of distributed systems,
                  systems engineers and researchers are facing novel challenges. In this talk, we analyze the role of
                  IoT, Edge, and Cloud, as well as AI in the co-evolution of distributed systems for the new decade. We
                  identify challenges and discuss a roadmap that these new distributed systems have to address. We take
                  a closer look at how a cyber-physical fabric will be complemented by AI operationalization to enable
                  seamless end-to-end distributed systems.

                <h3>Trust, Security and Privacy of 5G Positioning</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  The fifth-generation (5G) cellular network is expected to provide sub-meter positioning accuracy
                  without draining the battery of user equipment. As a solution, ultra-dense network (UDN) deployment
                  and network-based positioning were proposed. However, the openness of UDN and the vulnerability of
                  network devices (e.g., access nodes) make such a positioning system easy to be attacked. Moreover, due
                  to the sensitivity of positions, the privacy protection in both 5G positioning and its further
                  application in location-based services (LBSs) has been paid special attention. However, existing work
                  lacks deep investigation on the trust, security and privacy of 5G positioning and its related LBS
                  provision. In this talk, I will report our research results on these issues, including a number of
                  schemes to overcome jamming and collusion attacks in 5G positioning with positioning data truth
                  discovery and potential attacker tracing, to protect privacy for both end users and LBS providers
                  during LBS provision, and verifiable positioning with privacy preservation. Theoretical analysis and
                  experimental tests show the effectiveness of our schemes and their potential in practical deployment.
